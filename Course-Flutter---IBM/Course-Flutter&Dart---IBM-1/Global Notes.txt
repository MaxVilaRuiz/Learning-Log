To start a Flutter project:
    1. To enable web development in Flutter run:
        > flutter config --enable-web
    2. Verify that Flutter recognized the web enviroment by running (you should see "Chrome (web)" as one of the devices of the output. If it don't appear, install Google Chrome):
        > flutter devices
    3. Run flutter doctor to verify whether "Flutter", "Chrome" and "Connected Devices" are checked by running:
        > flutter doctor
    4. To create a new Flutter project run:
        > flutter create <name_of_the_project>
    5. To update all libraries run:
        > flutter pub get

To run a Flutter project run:
    > flutter run -d <platform>
    Ex: > flutter run -d chrome

Other commands:
    * Verify that Dart is installed run:
        > dart --version

    * Run a .dart doc:
        > dart <name_of_the_doc>.dart

Libraries:
    - To import a library type `import 'dart:<name_of_the_library>` at the beginning of the doc
    - Common libraries: math, async, convert, http package, intl package, path package
    - To create a library:
        1. Create a doc (ex: math_utils.dart)
        2. Type `library <name_of_the_doc>;` at the beginning of the doc
        3. Add the content (functions, variables, classes...)
        4. Import your library with `import '<name_of_the_doc>;` in another doc to use it.
