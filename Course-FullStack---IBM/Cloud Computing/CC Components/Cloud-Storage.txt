Fila Storage:
- Attached to, at least, one computer node to store data (can be mounted onto more than one).
- The speed vary (mid performance) --> Less expensive
- Less disk management and maintenance.
- Provision much larger amounts of file storage.
- Offer encrypted transit of data (secure).
- Common uses: departamental file share, landing zone for incoming files, repository files...

Block Storage:
- Breaks files into blocks of data and stores each block separately under a unique address. Must be attached to, at least, one computer node.
- Faster --> More expensive
- Adjust IOPS as you need.
- Data is more secure.
- Common uses: databases and mail servers.

Object Storage:
- Can be used without connecting to particular compute node (API - Application Program Interface). Good for large amount of unstructured data. The storage is organized with Buckets (Metadata - data about the data).
- Less expensive --> You pay for what you use (capacity). Higher frequency of acces to data --> Higher cost (Multiple tiers depending on the frequency of acces: Standard, Vault, Cold Vault).
- Can be used to store everything, but can't be suiztable for operating systems and databases.
