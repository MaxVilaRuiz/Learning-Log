* IOPS (Input / Output Operations Per Second): The speed at which the disks can write and read data. Higher IOPS --> faster speed of the disk --> higher costs.

* Metadata: data about the data.

* API: Application Program Interface.

* CDN (Content Delivery Networks): Distribute the content of a service all arount de world (as much endpoints it find). Then when the users try to access the service, it won't be necessary to send the content from the central server to the user locations.
