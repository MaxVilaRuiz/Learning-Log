Installation
	•	GitHub for Windows: https://windows.github.com
	•	GitHub for Mac: https://mac.github.com
	•	Git for All Platforms: http://git-scm.com

Initial Configuration (Tooling)
Configure user information for all local repositories:
    git config --global user.name "[name]"
    git config --global user.email "[email]"
    git config --global color.ui auto

Create Repositories
    • Initialize a new repository in the current directory:
        git init
    • Clone an existing repository from GitHub:
        git clone [url]

The .gitignore File
Use .gitignore to exclude files from being tracked by Git.
Helpful templates available at: github.com/github/gitignore

Working with Files and Changes
    • Add specific file changes to the staging area:
        git add NameOfTheDocument
    • Add all modified files:
        git add .
    • Commit staged changes with a message:   
        git commit -m "Description of the commit"
    • View repository status:
        git status
    • View commit history:
        git log
        git log --follow [file]
    • Show differences between working directory and last commit:
        git diff
        git diff Branch1 Branch2
    • Show details of a specific commit:
        git show [commit]

Branches
    • List existing branches:
        git branch
    • Create a new branch:
        git branch [branch-name]
    • Switch to another branch:
        git checkout [branch-name]
    • Merge changes from one branch into another (checkout to target branch first):
        git merge [branch-name]
    • Delete a local branch:
        git branch -d [branch-name]
    • Delete a remote branch:
        git push origin --delete [branch-name]

Synchronize Changes with Remote
    • Download history from remote branches:
        git fetch
    • Merge remote changes into local branch:
        git merge
    • Temporarily save uncommitted changes to clean the working directory:
        git stash
    • Reapply the last stashed changes after pulling or merging:
        git stash pop
    • Pull changes (fetch + merge || stash + pull + stash pop):
        git pull
    • Push local commits to a specific branch:
        git push origin [branch-name]

Undo and Redo Commits
    • Undo commits after a specific one (preserve local changes): 
        git reset [commit]
    • Discard all history and reset to a specific commit:
        git reset --hard [commit]
    • Discard all uncommitted changes and return to last commit:
        git reset --hard
    • Revert last commit (create a new commit that undoes changes):
        git revert

GitHub Flow
A simple branching workflow:
	1.	Create a feature branch from master.
	2.	Make commits on the feature branch.
	3.	Submit a Pull Request.
	4.	Discuss proposed changes, review, and make further commits.
	5.	Merge the feature branch into master.
