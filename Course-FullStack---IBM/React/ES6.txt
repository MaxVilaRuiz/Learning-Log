ES6 = EcmaScript
- Standards organization that creates a wide range of global information standards.

Variables:
* var: global scope (can be whatever)
* let: local scope (can change)
* const: constant values (cannot change)

Functions:
* Arrow functions: similar to calling variables, but with functions (can be declared with let and const - const is more frequent). Moreover, can be passed as parameters for callbacks
    No ES6: function sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello World!");
    }
    ES6: const sayHello = () => 
            console.log("Hello World!");
    ES6 (with parameters): const oneParam = (name) => {
                                return "hello" + name;
                            };

Classes:
* Constructor: method that creates an object of a class 
* Ex: class Rectangle {
        constructor(height, width) {
            this.height = height;
            this.width = width;
        }
}
