Types of Software Testing:
- Functional Testing:
    * Black Box testing: only test the input with the expected results (do not test de internal system).
- Non-Funcional Testing:
    * Test the performance, security, scalability and availability (technical tests).
- Regression Testing:
    * Confirms changes don't break the application.

Testing levels:
- Unit: checks the functionality of a single module.
- Integration: checks the functionality of a group of modules that have resently been united.
- System: checks the functionality of all the application (databases, modules, hardware...).
- Acceptance: checks wether the application works under the users demand (habitual behaviors).
